The concept of time in Napple World is unlike the real world: the seasons of spring, summer, autumn and winter exist separately from each other as distinct locations. When Poach arrives in Napple World, six fairy-like beings called Petals leave her body and escape into the seasons, and she must retrieve them in order to go home again. To make up for his mistake, Straynap becomes Poach's guide and instructs her throughout the game, explaining the often contradictory nature of Napple World to her.	</td></tr>

Huge amount of nigger jokes, purposely hidden implications that require a solid grasp of the context, occasional NVL segments with little to not visual aid, which are often vague and a single misunderstanding may harm your comprehension of the plot, etc. This is a VN you don't want to read very early, since it isn't really only about getting the "gist" of what's happening, but also being able to understand properly the situations and dialogues which directly relate to the overall thematic. Once in a while the descriptions may prolong for quite some time, and the random 豆知識 might be rather overwhelming.

Some parts are specially remarkable because of the writing, and a broken comprehension might ruin the whole thing for you.

As it was Tomohiko's debut work, the book isn't anywhere as good as Tatami Galaxy (I'm sure you've watched the anime) was and doesn't even really have an overarching plot. The book almost reads like a stream-of-consciousness autobiography until you realise it's fiction!

The way of delivery methods has changed since the creation of the super strong cardboard, which can resist every impact and keeping its contents intact. As the popularity of the material grew, so did its purposes. The super strong cardboard was used as material for special battlefields for LBX's, specialized miniature robots made by Tiny Orbit that were once banned due to their destructive purposes. Their popularity has again risen due to the specialized battlefield, and special models of LBX were made.
Four years after the creation of the super strong cardboard, in AD 2050, Ban Yamano (Van Yamano in the English dub), a male middle school student has been entrusted with the LBX ""AX-00"" by a mysterious woman, containing a Platinum Capsule. Van learned from the woman that his father is still alive and knew about a secret conspiracy in the government.

The story takes place between 1619 and 1630 during the Edo period and the reign of the Tokugawa shogunate. It tells the story of Hanshirō Tsugumo, a rōnin or warrior without a lord. On May 16, 1630, Tsugumo Hanshirō (津雲半四郎) arrives at the estate of the Ii clan (井伊家), looking for a suitable place to perform seppuku. After the Tokugawa shogunate took over, there were many roaming samurai without a master to serve. Some of these desperate rōnin would request or threat to commit seppuku in hopes of receiving alms from the lord of the house. To deter him Saitō Kageyu (Rentarō Mikuni), counselor of the clan, tells Hanshirō a warning story wherein another rōnin, Chijiiwa Motome – formerly of the same clan as Hanshirō – had made the same request and the samurai retainers of the house forced him to complete the ceremony and kill himself. Hanshiro is not detered, but the story plays a major role in the plot of the movie.	</td></tr>
