>DJOG
This version differs from the one already present in CoR in that it has a clickable TOC which makes navigation much easier. Scans quality leave much to be desired, as with all available versions. Good for use along with 日本語文法辞典全巻
WinDjView (free) is required to view djvu files
cornucopia > Seiichi Makino, Michio Tsutsui 2553475

>JGlossator
Insanely awesome software for use instead of TA/Jparser, shows all kanji and dictionary at a glance thus allowing you to acquire familiarity with Kanji much faster. Uses WWWJDIC as a base for glossing but there are some discrepancies so you might want to check rikaichan if something seems weird in a certain phrase. Isn't very good at deciphering complex grammar so a basic grasp of Japanese is required. Most useful for reading VNs or manga when you need to look up a couple of unfamiliar Kanji quickly. Absolutely awesome with Capture2Text and ITH for obvious reasons.
http://jglossator.sourceforge.net/#download - free

>TTS
If you are like me and have acquired a basic grasp of Japanese while watching a lot of cartoons, then you will probably have an easy time reading something alongside text-to-speech output. This is where this awesome software helps tremendously:
http://www.cross-plus-a.com/balabolka.htm - apparently free with a portable version available.
You can convert  an entire book into an mp3, or just use it to voice the contents of your clipboard (useful for browsing, or for use with Capture2Text and ITH). Now you can read manga or VN and get those unvoiced lines by protagonist voiced, also makes browsing the web much easier. I recommend setting up a global hotkey for ""voice clipboard"" function.
Get Japanese TTS engine here:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmGixWBZrOY
This is a perfectly functional and lightweight, if somewhat low quality engine (Haruka).
or if you have an access to a certain famous, ahem, cornucopia search for: Misaki (Kyoko) 1073524
Misaki in particular is very good and natural, weights around 720mb.
How to use:
1. Install Balabolka or use a portable version
2. Register your speech engine of choice
3. Setup global hotkeys for stuff like ""voice clipboard"", enable ""clipboard watch"" if you want it to auto-voice the contents of clipboard (useful in some usecases but annoying in others)
4. If you need to convert a book into an mp3, find the txt version or make it yourself and then right click > balabolka > convert to mp3, this will launch a separate process using your default engine settings, you can convert multiple books simultaneously and then load them onto your mp3 player to listen to (during sleep)
Example of use for manga:
1. Use Capture2Text to grab unfamiliar text
2. Capture2Text passes the data to clipboard
3. JGlossator displays glossing
4. Balabolka provides TTS (""clipboard watch"" function on)
Example of use for VN:
1. Use ITH to hook into game engine
2. ITH passes the data to clipboard
3. JGlossator displays glossing
4. Balabolka provides TTS (""clipboard watch"" function off so you can hear lines voiced by seiyuu normally, but press global hotkey for ""voice clipboard"" if you want to hear a line originally unvoiced)
This greatly speeds up the reading of VNs of reasonable complexity. Such manner of vocabulary acquisition is the closest you probably can achieve to emulating ""native acquisition"", as at first you get exposed to the sound of certain words and then (or simultaneously) to their written form.

>Dark Japanese
https://darkjapanese.wordpress.com/ A serious site for serious self-learners and those who have an interest in linguistics to a certain degree. If you don't understand anything there, it's probably not for you. If you have a high intelligence and motivation, you will find scientific papers and research provided there useful.
https://darkjapanese.wordpress.com/tools/ exceedingly useful toolset, have a look, it might save your life
http://ja-minimal.tumblr.com/ A self-study course from the authors of DJ so if you find the site incomprehensible, this is probably not for you. Use whatever you feel comfortable with.

>Stroke Orders
https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Stroke_Order_Project not enough love is given to the Wikipedia in the Guide, I feel, but there is no reason not to use their rather comprehesible references on various aspects related to Kanji and stuff. So here's the Stroke Order Project, which -you guessed it- will help you learn the stroke orders for Kanji, features ROC/PRC/Japanese versions.

>Watching anime with Japanese Subs
Arguably one of the best ways to acquire Kanji and general vocabulary, has benefits over trying to read low quality  scans of various literature as every line is voiced, so you can remember both the way a word is written AND pronounced, by a professional native seiyuu, no less.
So, how to get the most out of watching your Chinese cartoons?
1. Get subs from kitsunekko http://kitsunekko.net/dirlist.php?dir=subtitles/japanese -btw update link in DJT guide, that one is dead
2. Get something like a Daum PotPlayer (cor: 2143954 as of now)
3. Go to Preferences > Subtitles > Word Searching and setup it something like:
Condition: Use when playback is paused(Recommended)
Browser: System Default
Highest priority - Copy to clipboard
Second priority - https://translate.google.com/#ja/en/%%SS
4. Now, when you watch an interesting cartoon and encounter some unfamiliar word, simply pause the playback and click the subs - they will be copied to clipboard, and you can get JGlossator output, or right-click and select Google Translate if you would rather use that (Google Translate also has its own TTS). However, Google does not play nice with some subs split by spaces so JGlossator is usually more robust.
5. Practical result of such setup is that if you previously could not be assed to expand your vocabulary and would just settle for a translation of some unfamiliar word provided by a fansubber, now you can look up the word and kanji in several (milli)seconds, and understand it in context, which drastically improves comprehension and retention.


Oh, and my vote goes for imabi.net, this is really a great resource that provides a lot of information in a readable structured form in one place, I feel it deserves a much more prominent mention than just ""hey here's some obscure guide no one ever uses"" - well, if something is not popular (yet) it does not mean it's not good.
Current method of referencing things only adds to the confusion.
I would suggest structuring references to the various guides in a following manner perhaps:
If you are a beginner and/or native English speaker, wish to acquire a basic grasp of Japanese so that you can rely more on hearing and less on (Horrible) subs while you watch cartoons use:
Tae Kim http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar etc, whatever folks are into these days
If you are a somewhat advanced learner and need a comprehensive reference, wish to be able to read VNs of a reasonable complexity use:
imabi.net
If you are into weird shit and would like to know more Japanese than native Japanese folks, use:
https://darkjapanese.wordpress.com/

http://ja-minimal.tumblr.com/
That way everyone can find the resource that is fit for their needs, and there won't be meaningless holywars about which resource is the best - they are all arguably targeted toward different audiences, with stuff such as DJ being rather obscure yet indispensable nevertheless.

I suggest adding this to the guide, in case someone still uses some old shit to watch their cartoons - Potplayer has all codecs built in, renders subs nicely and is generally a very good player with useful features such as clickable subs as described by that /a/non.
I honestly think the guys in that thread are just not aware that software with such functional exists already, they are trying to re-invent the wheel.
https://github.com/TranslationPlayer/Trans-Player-Desktop is also perhaps worth a passing mention, but I can't see how it is more convenient than Potplayer + JGlossator link. Using Potplayer you get essentially fully fledged fullscreen viewing experience, and not some clumsy smallish window."

I have some of the movies in the 映画 link which are missing. If possible I'll restore those links in the same fashion over the upcoming weekend and post the links in this Feedback Form. Thanks for hosting this central djt webpage, it's really useful. On a side note, the DJT thread itself is full of hypersensitive entitled, whiny, insufferable little faggots. What a depressing shithole that general is."
"Cool, thanks. I'll add what's there now and then update it when you're done filling it in. On a side note, have you made any additions/changes outside of the 映画 sheet that aren't in the live version of the CoR that I should know about? Want the all in one package added to the live CoR next to the other decks? I'd add the sheet sizes, but I don't have the hard drive space to download everything to keep it accurate right now.",05/02/2016 19:13:38,"The 映画 sheet links have been restored.

Two of them I was unable to upload as for whatever reason their folders only contained subtitle files. A bit fucking out there but it is what it is. In the interest of 映画ファン I'm working on expanding the available selection. There is a decent amount being held by Miss Rutracker but directing English natives learning Japanese to a Russian site is a bit of dick move and having them a little more organised for easier browsing and downloading, well, why the fuck not だと思うんですよね。"
"Alright, I'll put it next to the rest of the Anki decks for now just in case someone might use it since it seems like a useful package to direct people who want more spoonfeeding than what the guide offers to. If you update it and need the link changed out feel free to submit the new link to feedback.",08/02/2016 15:40:58,">On a side note, have you made any additions/changes outside of the 映画 sheet that aren't in the live version of the CoR that I should know about? 
Not that I am aware of. I think the only differences are the entries with links being added at the moment on the 映画 sheet. Everything else should be the same. 

>Want the all in one package added to the live CoR next to the other decks? 
It was something I thought was a nice self contained guide with resources type thing and so stuck it at the top of each page with the other main links and was placed on personal whim. You are in a better position to judge whether or not such a thing ought be integrated into the proper CoR for a general audience of learners."

Functions as an accurate rip of said dictionary, unlike Nayr's core5k. By virtue of being an accurate rip of the dictionary, it has example sentences and frequency stats. Nayr's is a sentences deck, with the term and definitions combined. This is a proper vocab deck with the term split off from the definitions, and it's not based on Nayr's deck.

It was reordered to shift words that extensively show up in one register of communication much more than others down the list. So it's not in exactly the same order as the dictionary. Words that exclusively show up only in speech or only in books or whatever were shifted down.

Uses SVGs instead of fonts to display radicals, eliminating rendering problems with the key value.

Not ideal for Android. Since Noto Sans isn't embedded, there's no way to make sure that radicals in the Notes are rendered correctly. Maybe v5 should be kept around. Fonts might also still be useful for people on desktop that want the Notes to render correctly. But I unembedded everything but the SVGs to reduce the deck's filesize a lot. It's a little complicated.

Completely unrelated, but to the people in the threads (posting it here instead since they don't seem to be arguing about it right now and don't want to restart that):

Don't use a deck being in the CoR and another deck not being in the CoR as an argument for the deck in the CoR being better. If there's a problem generally agreed upon with one of the decks, just fix it in a way that those people agree is a good fix, upload it, submit it here provided a decent amount of people agree it's a good solution, and I can add it to the CoR. Nothing wrong with multiple formats being in the CoR.

These for example seem like good solutions to what people are complaining about (outside of the translations not having a way to display on mouseover or click on the first one):

I was using Anki with the default settings for months and it really impeded my progress. It's fine if you don't want to be too opinionated on how people should be using Anki, but you should at least give an overview of what the settings are and what the pros and cons are of modifying them."

I heard that  1568365594 is also real good, onomatopoieas are also cool like  1568364865. The graded readers seens great, but I know they are quite expensive and come with audio cd.

Introduction

Traveling to Japan to talk with the natives, watching raw anime or reading manga and novels before they’re translated all require the same fundamental skills and knowledge. While this guide is not going to be enough to teach you these things, it will give you an idea of how go about acquiring them.

With the basics covered in this guide you can get started with reading the written language, which you can then use to gain a more thorough understanding of Japanese. That being said, you should at no point hesitate to practice listening or speaking if you wish to do so. This guide only aims to introduce you to the Japanese language and show you how to get started, the rest is up to you."

"This honestly isn't really the sort of thing to be sending to the feedback form considering that domain/site doesn't really have anything to do with the main site other than serving as a link shortener and I'm not in contact with the guy who set it up, but I don't really think it's that big of a deal. It was never really a big deal before either from what I've seen. If the guy who runs the bitlasers domain wants to buy a new domain for it and gets in contact with me with proof it's him and not some random anon (lskj3rengwp2@gmail.com), then sure, but I don't think most people care and I don't trust that guy who's getting angry over it enough to let him do it since he could just change it to something malicious if he gets mad at DJT.",27/03/2016 21:34:33,"Hi, 
a question for the website owner: 
could you please move the website from a random 
business selling laser pointers to a root domain page? 
At the moment djt.moe is available to be registered
it would be perfect to have the front page hosted at 
djt.moe, or anywhere really
with the other pages using that root base
the buyfag thread uses http://www.buyfags.moe to 
host their  website and guide for example

It is really unsightly to have the djt site attached to 
an unrelated business.
If not I could look into setting this up myself and 
give the current owner access to it or something

Thank you for reading and passing on the message,

The link to the djt threads on desustorage
https://desustorage.org/a/search/subject/djt/
wouldn't something like that be better off not directly linked on the front page? I mean, it's kind of really, really overt spoonfeeding that would only benefit people who don't even browse /a/. 

Another thing is that having MOBILE DEVICES (OLD) and RESOURCES (OLD) up are kind of redundant and a lot of the links no longer work. For the links that do work and aren't in the current GUIDE RESOURCE LIST link, wouldn't it be better to put those links in that document and get rid of the out of date links from the front page? 
Also, is it really necessary to keep the OFFLINE link up? 

To summarise: 
Removing the following headings:
(PUBLIC QC)
OFFLINE
MOBILE DEVICES (OLD)
RESOURCES (OLD)
ARCHIVE
from the front page would clear it up and give it more focus.

Just an observation from someone who thinks that the front page is a little cluttered at the moment and that less links equals more focused direction."

nikkei/mainichi websites (fresh news from all the sections, from sports to technology), nikkei financial glossary, anime/tv professional glossaries

- monogatari series
- itoh keikaku
- yukikaze
- welcome to the nhk
- mardock scramble
- oreimo
- brave story

This is based on the SVG version except it's compatible with non-unicode filesystems. The filenames now contain the number and letter of the radical rather than its actual unicode character.

This also adds a new field for the media reference because anki no longer officially supports finding media from compound field references like <img src=""{{Expression}}"">. (It still works, but they could make it stop working at any time, and ankidroid is no longer incentivized to remain compatible with the way the deck used to work.)

This supersedes *BOTH* 2016 v6 (SVG version) and 2016 v5 (text version), because v5 has problems with OSs that have aggressive font aliasing such as certain linux distributions.

Two or three explanations were slightly changed to be easier to read."

"I like Neocities, but keeping the site in sync with my local version through the web interface is annoying. Uploading more than a few dozen files can be unreliable because uploads may fail without notice.

Netlify allows free users up to 100GB storage. Updating is easy because it automatically syncs with your Gitlab/Github repository. (The DJT Library is on Gitlab.) However, every time I make an update Netlify needs to download the entire 3GB repo from Gitlab, taking 30 minutes to deploy and failing half the time either because of the size or number of files. I try to make updates sparingly in case they get tired of me taxing their service.  You can also use it without Git, which I haven't tried -- it might be better.

I briefly used surge.sh for the library. It was easy to deploy, but after I uploaded the site they added an unspecified storage limit that prevents me from updating. Surge also needs to upload the entire site from your computer every time you make any change.

There are a few other decent looking free static hosts: Gitlab Pages (10GB limit), Github Pages (1GB) and Firebase (1GB).

It's definitely possible to start reading before the end of your grammar guide, but I think it's better to read up to at least a certain point, and since that point varies between guides, ""the end"" is the simplest recommendation.

The Sakubi anon said that he was revising the guide a while ago.",26/05/2017 00:34:27,"Pedantic guide suggestions:

When Yotsubato is mentioned in the Guide, it should bring up the reading pack. It's not brought up at least once. Without the reading pack, Yotsubato is essentially an ordinary easy manga, and not special to learners over other easy manga.

>Tae Kim should serve you fine for the easiest manga, but it only covers the most common grammar

""easiest"" -> ""easy"", ""but it only covers basic grammar"".

>After finishing Core2K, you’ll at least know the majority of words in a given sentence, but you will still have to look up many words per page.

""at least know"" -> ""be able to recognize""

>These logographic characters of varying complexity represent words or parts of words in conjunction with the kana. 

""In conjunction"" means ""when paired"", and because the string of text ""or part of words in conjunction with the kana"" can easily be interpreted as saying that Kanji are words, or are parts of words when paired with kana. ""These logographic characters of varying complexity represent parts of words, or sometimes whole words, as can the kana.""

>Japanese high school students are required to learn at least 2136 kanji as part of the curriculum, but around 3,000 are used in all facets of life.

""but up to around 3000 are used somewhat regularly in modern life"" (the ""up to around"" part is the important part to me there)

>Lookup a chart 

""Look up""

>You should also install Rikaisama (Firefox) or Rikaikun (Chrome),

Yomichan should be recommended as well for Chrome.

>You can do so either before starting vocab or at the same time, but you should try to finish up in a few months so you can focus on vocabulary.

More emphasis should be placed on quickness here, when starting kanji study before vocab study.

>Once you have read through your chosen grammar guide, you are ready to start reading Japanese. 

I appreciate the choice of the phrase ""read through"" instead of ""finish"" here, but it also shouldn't sound like people aren't ready to start reading just because they haven't gotten to the end of it yet.

By the way, what happened to Sakubi? Is it still bad?"

a little update:
the highlight buttons now highlight the entire test
description area of a single entry
-trade off: individual genre tags are not highlighted
with a clear selection button with each entry

also added a simple button which allows
anons to scroll back to top with a single 
press, for navigation ease. 
It may not be useful at the moment but
I figure once the rest of the CoR contents
are added, it will end up rather long in the

manually a pain.

Why this information posted is because the site
itself has been archived along with a tabbed spaced 
version of the manga data and volumes missing from 
the CoR, as per the previous data the site maintainer
provided. 

At the bottom is a mega link. This will remain online 
with the intention of someone with knowledge of webdev 
and programming to take this data and improve the site.

Relevant information for any added series can be 
posted to djt feedback, for the CoR, or if anyone
else decides to host/overhaul the current manga site.

The sorts of requested features are simply above 
my level of knowledge or desire to dedicate time
to learn. This is why someone who knows these things
are much better suited to handle this sort of thing.
Hopefully the data I have provided can be easily
enough slotted into a database and handled
programmatically, as I have been told is the 
preferred method for these sorts of things.


The moemanga.neocities website will remain, as I intend
to over time continue to add the not yet added series
found on Sheet12 of the Google Sheet linked at 
the bottom. However, as mentioned above, the only
further time spent on the site will be when the previously
mentioned manga series are added.
